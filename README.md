<a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> is an extremely popular app used by millions of developers to interact with API endpoints. Postman comes with a cool specification/feature called "collections" that allows people to share a set of APIs with others with **pre-populated sample data, headers, url params, etc**. 

#### ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥  This means other developers just have import the "collection" spec and simply change the data as needed and interact with the API endpoints right away without worrying about if they are passing the data properly or not!

## ðŸŒŸ HTTP POST 
(already pre-populated sample data, headers, urls, etc)

2. Start using it by changing the data as needed.


## Notes:
- The collection itself is a port from [oas3.yaml](https://github.com/rajaraodv/scalyr-oas3/blob/master/oas3.yaml) from [Scalyr-oas3](project).
- OAS3.0 was converted to Postman collection 2.0 by using [APIMatic](https://apimatic.io/transformer)
- If you update oas3.0 spec on [scalyr-oas3](https://github.com/rajaraodv/scalyr-oas3), please regenerate the postman-collections2.0.json to keep everything upto date.
